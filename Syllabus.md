**Participation and in class work:**  We will be doing a lot of in class work which is critical to your understanding of the material and drives the entire class' learning.  As a result I take your effort in it very seriously. Participating does not simply mean showing up for class. It means fully engaging and contributing to the class discussion.  A detailed explanation that applies both to lectures as well as in-class work can be found at[ *http://www.cs.ccsu.edu/~williams/classes/WhatDoesClassParticipationMean.pdf*](http://www.cs.ccsu.edu/~williams/classes/WhatDoesClassParticipationMean.pdf).

Finally, I know you are very bright otherwise you wouldn't be here, and I value your ideas and contributions in making this class better. Because I believe your active participation makes the class a better learning experience for all, I appreciate your questions anytime you donâ€™t fully understand something or questions on how the material might be applied in practice. I do not expect you to know all of the answers. Thoughtful participation regardless of correctness will be rewarded.

**Assignments:** Assignment guidelines: While most work in this class will be turned in electronically, any hand written work you turn in to me must be neat and readable. If I can't read it I will not score points for that portion.

 You should begin each assignment as it is handed out. By starting assignments early, you have the opportunity to ask me to clarify those things you do not understand. It is essential that you commit yourself to regular studying to keep pace with the course and deadlines. If you are having difficulty with any aspect of this class, please talk to me in a timely manner. I will do my best to help you. More options will be available to us if you approach me as soon as possible. Unless arrangements have been made ahead of time ***late assignments will be penalized 10% per day (7am the next day is the same as 11:59pm that evening)***. ***No submissions will be accepted after the final.***

**Final project:** There will be a large final project that will require integrating the knowledge you have gained throughout the semester.  Details on this project will be handed out later in the semester.  At the end of the semester your group will present your project to the class.

There will be a number of interim checkpoints during the semester to ensure you are on track. The final deliverables are due at the beginning of class Monday, December 4th.

**Exams:** There will be a midterm and a final exam in addition to a final project. These will focus on whether you have understood the material and learned from your mistakes. The midterm will tentatively be **Wednesday, October 18th TBD** and the final exam will be at the university scheduled time **Monday, December 11th 5:30-7:30pm**. If a student misses the midterm they will receive a 0 unless they have specifically talked with me ahead of time and submit a written request.

**Attendance:** I expect students to attend class sessions regularly. ***For each absence (unless university excused) over 3 your overall final grade will be reduced by 1/4th of a letter grade. Skipping classes can seriously affect your final grade!*** If you are going to miss class please email me before class. Each student is responsible for making-up any missed study or work on their own. Limited assistance will be offered to those with plausible reasons for absences; unexcused absences result in the student being totally responsible for the make-up process. You are responsible for all announcements and material covered in the event that you do miss class, and should get that information from one of your classmates. In the event of a weather emergency that requires curtailment or cancellation of classes, listen to WTIC (1080 AM) or call (860) 832-3333.

**Academic Honesty:** Students are expected to practice the highest standards of ethics, honesty and integrity in all of their academic work. Any form of academic dishonesty (e.g., plagiarism, cheating and misrepresentation) may result in disciplinary action. Possible disciplinary actions may include failure for part of or all of a course as well as suspension from the University. I absolutely require that you fulfill your academic obligations in a fair and honest manner. This includes turning in work that is uniquely yours, unless I explicitly require you to work on a project in a group. I strongly suggest that if you work with others, you only work together in the idea generation phase. When it comes to writing your work, you must do so independently. It is in your best interest to never look at any assignments written by another student and to never let another student see any assignments you have written. If you do turn in work that I suspect is the result of cheating, it will be dealt with **harshly**. You may find the full Academic Misconduct Policy online at:

http://www.ccsu.edu/academicintegrity/

 Please read it carefully.

**Students with disabilities**: Please contact me privately to discuss your specific needs if you believe you need course accommodations based on the impact of a disability, medical condition, or if you have emergency medical information to share. I will need a copy of the accommodation letter from Student Disability Services in order to arrange your class accommodations. Contact Student Disability Services, Willard Hall, 101-04 if you are not already registered with them. Student Disability Services maintains the confidential documentation of your disability and assists you in coordinating reasonable accommodations with your faculty.

**Statement on Discrimination and Harassment**: Central Connecticut State University strives to maintain our campus as a place of work and study for faculty, staff, and students that is free of all forms of prohibited discrimination and harassment based upon age; ancestry, color; gender identity and expression; intellectual disability; learning disability; mental disorder; physical disability; marital status, national origin; race; religious creed; sex, (including pregnancy, transgender status, sexual harassment and sexual assault); sexual orientation; or any other status protected by federal or state laws. Any student who has concerns about should contact the Office of Diversity and Equity (ODE) at 860-832-1652, Student Affairs at 860-832-1601, or his/her faculty member. The ODE is located on the main floor of Davidson Hall, room 102.

**Sexual Misconduct, Intimate Partner Violence and Stalking** Central Connecticut State University (CCSU) will not tolerate sexual misconduct against students, staff, faculty, or visitors in any form, including but not limited to: sexual assault, sexual exploitation, sexual harassment or stalking, as defined in CCSU policies.

**How to succeed in CS 493**:

-   **Pay attention to feedback in class discussions. I often make corrections to points brought up in the oral discussion which I may not mention specifically in the written feedback so pay attention.**

-   **USE OFFICE HOURS! **

    -   Work through practice problems

    -   Discuss some topic you are having difficulty with

    -   Put simply, if you are confused come see me. While I have posted office hours, feel free to stop by anytime or make an appointment with me if you want to make sure I'm available at a specific time.

-   **Participate in all discussions**. It is the best way to realize quickly if you are missing any important points so that you don't make similar mistakes on the mid-term, final, and/or final project.

-   **Get involved** in lectures. Don't be afraid to ask for clarification or additional explanation, chances are if you are confused someone else is as well.

-   **Keep all returned work to help you to study for the exams**
